Executing tricky Django migrations without downtime\r\nDjango makes it incredibly easy to change the schema of your database when you make a simple change to one of your Python models. However, when you need to make more complicated changes (especially changes involving data), it isn't always obvious how to perform the change without downtime. In this first post, we'll go over how to create and perform a sequence of migrations for a relatively tricky model change, all without interruption to our end users.\r\n\r\n## The setup\r\nLet's start with a bare-bones Django app. We have a single model called `Note` in which our various users post daily log messages.\r\n\r\n    class Note(models.Model):\r\n        user = models.ForeignKey(User)\r\n        date_and_text = models.TextField(blank=True)\r\n\r\nThe guy who designed this did a clumsy job, where the user types both the date and the note text in the same field. After a few months with this system, we want to switch it out to something more reasonable:\r\n\r\n    class Note(models.Model):\r\n        user = models.ForeignKey(User)\r\n        date = models.DateField(auto_now=True)\r\n        text = models.TextField()\r\n    \r\n        class Meta:\r\n            unique_together = (('user', 'date'),)\r\n\r\nHere, we've split out the date field and made it automatic (our users no longer have to enter it manually!). The note text is no longer optional, and we're going to be heavy-handed in enforcing that each user can only have one note per day (see the `unique_together`).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
