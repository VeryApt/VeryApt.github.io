Executing tricky Django migrations without downtime\r\nDjango makes it incredibly easy to change the schema of your database when you make a simple change to one of your Python models. However, when you need to make more complicated changes (especially changes involving data), it isn't always obvious how to perform the change without downtime. In this first post, we'll go over how to create and perform a sequence of migrations for a relatively tricky model change, all without interruption to our end users.\r\n\r\n## The setup\r\nLet's start with a bare-bones Django app. We have a single model called `Note` in which our various users post daily log messages.\r\n\r\n    class Note(models.Model):\r\n        user = models.ForeignKey(User)\r\n        date_and_text = models.TextField()\r\n\r\nThe guy who designed this did a clumsy job, where the user types both the date and the note text in the same field. After a few months with this system, we want to switch it out to something more reasonable:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Note(models.Model):\r\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User)\r\n    date = models.DateField(auto_now=True)\r\n    text = models.TextField()\r\n\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        unique_together = (('user', 'date'),)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, we've split out the date field and made it automatic (our users no longer have to enter it manually!). The note text is no longer optional, and we're going to be heavy-handed in enforcing that each user can only have one note per day (see the `unique_together`).\r\n\r\nLet's assume that our users currently view and edit these notes in the Django admin. In our current `admin.py`, we have:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.contrib import admin\r\nfrom .models import Note\r\n\r\n\r\nclass NoteAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\r\n    fields = ('user', 'date_and_text')\r\nadmin.site.register(Note, NoteAdmin)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Our goal is to move from the old Note model to the new Note model behind the scenes, without any affect on our admin-site users.**\r\n\r\nThis is tricky for a few reasons:\r\n* We need to parse and copy data between the text fields.\r\n* We're adding a non-empty field (`text`) to the DB when production code might not be expecting it.\r\n* The new model has `auto_now` automatic timestamps, but we need to insert back-dated values for existing notes.\r\n* The new model has a unique constraint that involves fresh new fields which aren't prepared yet.\r\n* Plus, the existing data might not even satisfy that constraint.\r\n* All these changes need to happen seamlessly, without downtime either on the servers or the database.\r\n* We have a cluster of webservers (not just one), which receive code updates in rolling batches. In other words, different live webservers might have different code versions.\r\n\r\n## The wrong ways\r\n\r\nIn this section, I'm going to attempt this migration in the shoes of a Django novice and show where/how/why it goes wrong. Feel free to skip over to the next section!\r\n\r\n",
