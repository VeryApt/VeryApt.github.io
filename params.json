Executing tricky Django migrations without downtime\r\nDjango makes it incredibly easy to change the schema of your database when you make a simple change to one of your Python models. However, when you need to make more complicated changes (especially changes involving data), it isn't always obvious how to perform the change without downtime. In this first post, we'll go over how to create and perform a sequence of migrations for a relatively tricky model change, all without interruption to our end users.\r\n\r\n## The setup\r\nLet's start with a bare-bones Django app. We have a single model called `Note` in which our various users post daily log messages.\r\n\r\n    class Note(models.Model):\r\n        user = models.ForeignKey(User)\r\n        date_and_text = models.TextField()\r\n\r\nThe guy who designed this did a clumsy job, where the user types both the date and the note text in the same field. A note `date_and_text` entry looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2016-02-15\r\nEverything looks good for today!\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter a few months with this system, we want to switch it out to something more reasonable:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Note(models.Model):\r\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User)\r\n    date = models.DateField(auto_now=True)\r\n    text = models.TextField()\r\n\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        unique_together = (('user', 'date'),)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, we've split out the date field and made it automatic (our users no longer have to enter it manually!). The note text is no longer optional, and we're going to be heavy-handed in enforcing that each user can only have one note per day (see the `unique_together`).\r\n\r\nLet's assume that our users currently view and edit these notes in the Django admin. In our current `admin.py`, we have:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.contrib import admin\r\nfrom .models import Note\r\n\r\n\r\nclass NoteAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\r\n    fields = ('user', 'date_and_text')\r\nadmin.site.register(Note, NoteAdmin)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Our goal is to move from the old Note model to the new Note model behind the scenes, without any affect on our admin-site users.**\r\n\r\nThis is tricky for a few reasons:\r\n* We need to parse and copy data between the text fields.\r\n* We're adding a non-empty field (`text`) to the DB when production code might not be expecting it.\r\n* The new model has `auto_now` automatic timestamps, but we need to insert back-dated values for existing notes.\r\n* The new model has a unique constraint that involves fresh new fields which aren't prepared yet.\r\n* Plus, the existing data might not even satisfy that constraint.\r\n* All these changes need to happen seamlessly, without downtime either on the servers or the database.\r\n* We have a cluster of webservers (not just one), which receive code updates in rolling batches. In other words, different live webservers might have different code versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other code\r\n\r\nAside from the above changes in `models.py`, we want to update the admin site for the new Note version. Our new `NoteAdmin` will be:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass NoteAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\r\n    fields = ('user', 'date', 'text')\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll need a way to split the old-style `date_and_text` field into `date` and `text` components. We'll write a small parser and put it somewhere in the project:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\ndef parse_date_and_text(date_and_text):\r\n    header, text = date_and_text.split('\\n', 1)\r\n    date = datetime.strptime(header.strip(), '%Y-%m-%d').date()\r\n    return date, text\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## The wrong ways\r\n\r\nIn this section, I'm going to attempt this migration in the shoes of a Django novice and show where/how/why it goes wrong. Feel free to skip over to the next section to learn a better way of doing things!\r\n\r\n### \"I've never done this before\"\r\n\r\n1. Replace old `Note` fields with new fields in `models.py`.\r\n2. Run `python manage.py makemigrations myapp` with the following choices:\r\n    * selecting \"No\" for \"Did you rename note.date_and_text to note.text (a TextField)?\" (I guess we could have)\r\n    * selecting \"1\" and entering `timezone.now()` for \"You are trying to add a non-nullable field...\" for `date`\r\n    * selecting \"1\" and entering `''` for \"You are trying to add a non-nullable field...\" for `text`\r\n3. Run `python manage.py migrate`\r\n4. Deploy new code (new version of `models.py` to webservers)!\r\n\r\nDjango tries to be pretty helpful here by asking if we're renaming our text field. It also lets us easily provide a default value for our new, non-nullable fields.\r\n\r\nWe quickly hit a problem in step 3, though. The command fails with `django.db.utils.IntegrityError: indexed columns are not unique`. The error comes up because we just added our new note text field, which is empty, yet we have specified a constraint making it unique.\r\n\r\n### \"My first data migration\"\r\n\r\nTo get around this uniqueness error, let's add a *data migration* step into our migrations file. We'll parse and copy over the old `date_and_text` field *before* adding in that new uniqueness constraint. Our migration file now looks like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nfrom django.db import migrations, models\r\nfrom django.utils.timezone import utc\r\n\r\n\r\ndef parse_date_and_text(date_and_text):\r\n    header, text = date_and_text.split('\\n', 1)\r\n    date = datetime.strptime(header.strip(), '%Y-%m-%d').date()\r\n    return date, text\r\n\r\n\r\ndef forwards(apps, schema_editor):\r\n    Note = apps.get_model('myapp', 'Note')\r\n    for note in Note.objects.all():\r\n        note.date, note.text = parse_date_and_text(note.date_and_text)\r\n        note.save()\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Migration(migrations.Migration):\r\n\r\n    dependencies = [\r\n        ('myapp', '0001_initial'),\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    operations = [\r\n        migrations.AddField(\r\n            model_name='note',\r\n            name='date',\r\n            field=models.DateField(auto_now=True, default=datetime(2016, 4, 8, 18, 21, 10, 499000, tzinfo=utc)),\r\n            preserve_default=False,\r\n        ),\r\n        migrations.AddField(\r\n            model_name='note',\r\n            name='text',\r\n            field=models.TextField(default=''),\r\n            preserve_default=False,\r\n        ),\r\n        migrations.RunPython(forwards),\r\n        migrations.RemoveField(\r\n            model_name='note',\r\n            name='date_and_text',\r\n        ),\r\n        migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(\r\n            name='note',\r\n            unique_together=set([('user', 'date')]),\r\n        ),\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat changed? We created a function called `forwards` that performs our data operation. In Django migrations, we don't use the standard `from models import Note`. Instead, the migration provides a surrogate model that we retrieved through `Note = apps.get_model('myapp', 'Note')`.\r\n\r\nWe then wedge this `forwards()` data operation into the steps of `Migration.operations`. It is carefully placed *after* adding the new fields, *before* removing the old fields, and *before* adding that problematic uniqueness constraint. Why? We want our data operation to have access to both the old and new model fields. Within the `forwards()` function, we iterate over all existing Note objects and parse the old `date_and_text` field into the new `date` and `text` fields.\r\n\r\nLet's try again! Run `python manage.py migrate`. Sadly, I'm getting the same error: `django.db.utils.IntegrityError: indexed columns are not unique`. You might not get this error, but I did, because I happened to have multiple notes in my database with the same user and date! Never assume that your existing data will go along with new constraints.\r\n\r\n### \"This is more work than I thought...\"\r\n\r\nLet's modify the existing data operation step to clean up notes that will run afoul of our uniqueness constraint. Since the constraint hasn't been applied at the time Django runs the `forwards()` function, we're free to handle this ourselves. Here's how I've done it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom collections import defaultdict\r\ndef forwards(apps, schema_editor):\r\n    Note = apps.get_model('myapp', 'Note')\r\n    user_date_notes = defaultdict(list)\r\n    for note in Note.objects.all():\r\n        note.date, note.text = parse_date_and_text(note.date_and_text)\r\n        note.save()\r\n        user_date_notes[(note.user, note.date)].append(note)\r\n\r\n    # Merge any notes from the same user on the same date\r\n    for same_date_notes in user_date_notes.values():\r\n        if len(same_date_notes) > 1:\r\n            new_text = '\\n\\n'.join([note.text for note in same_date_notes])\r\n            same_date_notes[0].text = new_text\r\n            same_date_notes[0].save()\r\n            for i in range(1, len(same_date_notes)):\r\n                same_date_notes[i].delete()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've modified the existing `forwards()` operation to keep lists of all notes that share the same user and the same date. When one of those lists has more than one note, I merge the note text, save it to the first note, then delete the other notes. Now our data should be unique! Let's try to run this one more time: `python manage.py migrate`. It works!\r\n\r\n### \"So that's it! Right?\"\r\n\r\nIt's true that we've successfully updated our schema to match our new Note object, and we've successfully copied over the new data. However, this is nowhere near useful for a production environment! Say we apply this migration to our production database. In the minutes before we can apply our new Python code to the webservers, they'll all be failing with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOperationalError at /admin/myapp/note/\r\nno such column: myapp_note.date_and_text\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy is this happening? In the moments between migrating the database and updating our webservers with the new Python code (i.e. our new `models.py` and new `admin.py`), the existing live code on the webservers doesn't know that the database schema has been changed. The live code is looking for our old `date_and_text` field in the database, but it doesn't exist any more! For any production environment, having a period where your site is crashing like this, even if just for a few minutes, is unacceptable.\r\n\r\n(Also, another issue: our migration wasn't reversible, so if something went wrong and we wanted to back-track to our earlier state, we'd be out of luck!)\r\n\r\n## The right way\r\n\r\nIn this section, we'll start over. We're going to craft this model change into a series of migrations and code deployments, designed so that our users don't experience a second of downtime.\r\n\r\n### The general principles\r\n\r\nIn general, for a seamless migration experience we'll structure our migrations with the following order:\r\n\r\n1. Add new things & loosen constraints\r\n2. Migrate data and switch live code to new things\r\n3. Remove old things & tighten constraints.\r\n\r\nWe saw how constraints could come to bite us in the previous section. Now, we'll plan for them ahead of time, and split up our migrations and code deployments so that we don't impact our end users.\r\n\r\nPlus, as a general good practice, we'll *design all our migrations to be reversible* so we have an out if something goes wrong.\r\n\r\n### 1. Add new things & loosen constraints\r\n\r\nThis time, let's add our new fields to the original `Note` model but leave the old ones in place (for now). Also, we'll hold off on any constraints or special features, and loosen existing constraints:\r\n\r\n* I've left out `auto_now=True` from the `date` field so we can back-fill it during migrations (it technically worked during the last section without any special treatment, but we'll be pedantic).\r\n* I've added `null=True, blank=True` to the `date` field.\r\n* I've added `blank=True` to the `date_and_text` field.\r\n* I've added `blank=True` to the `text` field.\r\n* I've left out the uniqueness constraint.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Note(models.Model):\r\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User)\r\n    date_and_text = models.TextField(blank=True)\r\n    date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\r\n    text = models.TextField(blank=True)\r\n```",
