Executing tricky Django migrations without downtime\r\nDjango makes it incredibly easy to change the schema of your database when you make a simple change to one of your Python models. However, when you need to make more complicated changes (especially changes involving data), it isn't always obvious how to perform the change without downtime. In this first post, we'll go over how to create and perform a sequence of migrations for a relatively tricky model change, all without interruption to our end users.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: Django 1.9\r\n\r\n## The setup\r\nLet's start with a bare-bones Django app. We have a single model called `Note` in which our various users post daily log messages.\r\n\r\n    class Note(models.Model):\r\n        user = models.ForeignKey(User)\r\n        date_and_text = models.TextField()\r\n\r\nThe guy who designed this did a clumsy job, where the user types both the date and the note text in the same field. A note `date_and_text` entry looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2016-02-15\r\nEverything looks good for today!\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter a few months with this system, we want to switch it out to something more reasonable:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Note(models.Model):\r\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User)\r\n    date = models.DateField(auto_now=True)\r\n    text = models.TextField()\r\n\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        unique_together = (('user', 'date'),)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, we've split out the date field and made it automatic (our users no longer have to enter it manually!). The note text is no longer optional, and we're going to be heavy-handed in enforcing that each user can only have one note per day (see the `unique_together`).\r\n\r\nLet's assume that our users currently view and edit these notes in the Django admin. In our current `admin.py`, we have:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.contrib import admin\r\nfrom .models import Note\r\n\r\n\r\nclass NoteAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\r\n    fields = ('user', 'date_and_text')\r\nadmin.site.register(Note, NoteAdmin)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Our goal is to move from the old Note model to the new Note model behind the scenes, without any effect on our admin-site users.**\r\n\r\nThis is tricky for a few reasons:\r\n* We need to parse and copy data between the text fields.\r\n* We're adding a non-empty field (`text`) to the DB when production code might not be expecting it.\r\n* The new model has `auto_now` automatic timestamps, but we need to insert back-dated values for existing notes.\r\n* The new model has a unique constraint that involves fresh new fields which aren't prepared yet.\r\n* Plus, the existing data might not even satisfy that constraint.\r\n* All these changes need to happen seamlessly, without downtime either on the servers or the database.\r\n* We have a cluster of webservers (not just one), which receive code updates in rolling batches. In other words, different live webservers might have different code versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other code\r\n\r\nAside from the above changes in `models.py`, we want to update the admin site for the new Note version. Our new `NoteAdmin` will be:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass NoteAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\r\n    fields = ('user', 'date', 'text')\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll need a way to split the old-style `date_and_text` field into `date` and `text` components. We'll write a small parser and put it somewhere in the project:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\ndef parse_date_and_text(date_and_text):\r\n    header, text = date_and_text.split('\\n', 1)\r\n    date = datetime.strptime(header.strip(), '%Y-%m-%d').date()\r\n    return date, text\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## The wrong ways\r\n\r\nIn this section, I'm going to attempt this migration in the shoes of a Django novice and show where/how/why it goes wrong. Feel free to skip over to the next section to learn a better way of doing things!\r\n\r\n### \"I've never done this before\"\r\n\r\n1. Replace old `Note` fields with new fields in `models.py`.\r\n2. Run `python manage.py makemigrations myapp` with the following choices:\r\n    * selecting \"No\" for \"Did you rename note.date_and_text to note.text (a TextField)?\" (I guess we could have)\r\n    * selecting \"1\" and entering `timezone.now()` for \"You are trying to add a non-nullable field...\" for `date`\r\n    * selecting \"1\" and entering `''` for \"You are trying to add a non-nullable field...\" for `text`\r\n3. Run `python manage.py migrate`\r\n4. Deploy new code (new version of `models.py`) to webservers!\r\n\r\nDjango tries to be pretty helpful here by asking if we're renaming our text field. It also lets us easily provide a default value for our new, non-nullable fields.\r\n\r\nWe quickly hit a problem in step 3, though. The command fails with `django.db.utils.IntegrityError: indexed columns are not unique`. The error comes up because we just added our new note text field, which is empty, yet we have specified a constraint making it unique.\r\n\r\n### \"My first data migration\"\r\n\r\nTo get around this uniqueness error, let's add a *data migration* step into our migrations file. We'll parse and copy over the old `date_and_text` field *before* adding in that new uniqueness constraint. Our migration file now looks like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nfrom django.db import migrations, models\r\nfrom django.utils.timezone import utc\r\n\r\n\r\ndef parse_date_and_text(date_and_text):\r\n    header, text = date_and_text.split('\\n', 1)\r\n    date = datetime.strptime(header.strip(), '%Y-%m-%d').date()\r\n    return date, text\r\n\r\n\r\ndef forwards(apps, schema_editor):\r\n    Note = apps.get_model('myapp', 'Note')\r\n    for note in Note.objects.all():\r\n        note.date, note.text = parse_date_and_text(note.date_and_text)\r\n        note.save()\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Migration(migrations.Migration):\r\n\r\n    dependencies = [\r\n        ('myapp', '0001_initial'),\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    operations = [\r\n        migrations.AddField(\r\n            model_name='note',\r\n            name='date',\r\n            field=models.DateField(auto_now=True, default=datetime(2016, 4, 8, 18, 21, 10, 499000, tzinfo=utc)),\r\n            preserve_default=False,\r\n        ),\r\n        migrations.AddField(\r\n            model_name='note',\r\n            name='text',\r\n            field=models.TextField(default=''),\r\n            preserve_default=False,\r\n        ),\r\n        migrations.RunPython(forwards),\r\n        migrations.RemoveField(\r\n            model_name='note',\r\n            name='date_and_text',\r\n        ),\r\n        migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(\r\n            name='note',\r\n            unique_together=set([('user', 'date')]),\r\n        ),\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat changed? We created a function called `forwards` that performs our data operation. In Django migrations, we don't use the standard `from models import Note`. Instead, the migration provides a surrogate model that we retrieved through `Note = apps.get_model('myapp', 'Note')`.\r\n\r\nWe then wedge this `forwards()` data operation into the steps of `Migration.operations`. It is carefully placed *after* adding the new fields, *before* removing the old fields, and *before* adding that problematic uniqueness constraint. Why? We want our data operation to have access to both the old and new model fields. Within the `forwards()` function, we iterate over all existing Note objects and parse the old `date_and_text` field into the new `date` and `text` fields.\r\n\r\nLet's try again! Run `python manage.py migrate`. Sadly, I'm getting the same error: `django.db.utils.IntegrityError: indexed columns are not unique`. You might not get this error, but I did, because I happened to have multiple notes in my database with the same user and date! Never assume that your existing data will go along with new constraints.\r\n\r\n### \"This is more work than I thought...\"\r\n\r\nLet's modify the existing data operation step to clean up notes that will run afoul of our uniqueness constraint. Since the constraint hasn't been applied at the time Django runs the `forwards()` function, we're free to handle this ourselves. Here's how I've done it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom collections import defaultdict\r\ndef forwards(apps, schema_editor):\r\n    Note = apps.get_model('myapp', 'Note')\r\n    user_date_notes = defaultdict(list)\r\n    for note in Note.objects.all():\r\n        note.date, note.text = parse_date_and_text(note.date_and_text)\r\n        note.save()\r\n        user_date_notes[(note.user, note.date)].append(note)\r\n\r\n    # Merge any notes from the same user on the same date\r\n    for same_date_notes in user_date_notes.values():\r\n        if len(same_date_notes) > 1:\r\n            new_text = '\\n\\n'.join([note.text for note in same_date_notes])\r\n            same_date_notes[0].text = new_text\r\n            same_date_notes[0].save()\r\n            for i in range(1, len(same_date_notes)):\r\n                same_date_notes[i].delete()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've modified the existing `forwards()` operation to keep lists of all notes that share the same user and the same date. When one of those lists has more than one note, I merge the note text, save it to the first note, then delete the other notes. Now our data should be unique! Let's try to run this one more time: `python manage.py migrate`. It works!\r\n\r\n### \"So that's it! Right?\"\r\n\r\nIt's true that we've successfully updated our schema to match our new Note object, and we've successfully copied over the new data. However, this is nowhere near useful for a production environment! Say we apply this migration to our production database. In the minutes before we can apply our new Python code to the webservers, they'll all be failing with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOperationalError at /admin/myapp/note/\r\nno such column: myapp_note.date_and_text\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy is this happening? In the moments between migrating the database and updating our webservers with the new Python code (i.e. our new `models.py` and new `admin.py`), the existing live code on the webservers doesn't know that the database schema has been changed. The live code is looking for our old `date_and_text` field in the database, but it doesn't exist any more! For any production environment, having a period where your site is crashing like this, even if just for a few minutes, is unacceptable.\r\n\r\n(Also, another issue: our migration wasn't reversible, so if something went wrong and we wanted to back-track to our earlier state, we'd be out of luck!)\r\n\r\n## The right way\r\n\r\nIn this section, we'll start over. We're going to craft this model change into a series of migrations and code deployments, designed so that our users don't experience a second of downtime.\r\n\r\n### The general principles\r\n\r\nIn general, for a seamless migration experience we'll structure our migrations with the following order:\r\n\r\n1. Add new things & loosen constraints\r\n2. Switch live code to new things\r\n4. Migrate data\r\n3. Remove old things & tighten constraints.\r\n\r\nWe saw how constraints could come to bite us in the previous section. Now, we'll plan for them ahead of time, and split up our migrations and code deployments so that we don't impact our end users.\r\n\r\nPlus, as a general good practice, we'll *design all our migrations to be reversible* so we have an out if something goes wrong.\r\n\r\n### 1. Add new things & loosen constraints\r\n\r\nThis time, let's add our new fields to the original `Note` model but leave the old ones in place (for now). Also, we'll hold off on any constraints or special features, and loosen existing constraints:\r\n\r\n* I've left out `auto_now=True` from the `date` field so we can back-fill it during migrations (it technically worked during the last section without any special treatment, but we'll be pedantic).\r\n* I've added `null=True, blank=True` to the `date` field.\r\n* I've added `blank=True` to the `date_and_text` field.\r\n* I've added `blank=True` to the `text` field.\r\n* I've left out the uniqueness constraint.\r\n\r\nThe `Note` model is now defined as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Note(models.Model):\r\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User)\r\n    date_and_text = models.TextField(blank=True)\r\n    date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\r\n    text = models.TextField(blank=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo recap, I've added the new `date` and `text` fields, but I haven't removed the `date_and_text` field. I'm keeping it around so I can access its data when it comes time to do our data migration.\r\n\r\nI've also removed or left out several constraints: all of the fields that we're touching in this migration can now be null. This way, when we migrate the database, live (but old) code on the webservers won't complain about the new `text` and `date` fields (these will be in the database but not yet in the Python code). *After* we deploy, *new* code on the webservers won't complain about blank values in the (soon-to-be-removed) `date_and_text` field (still in the database, but no longer in the Python code).\r\n\r\nLet's create our first migration: `python manage.py makemigrations myapp`\r\n\r\n### 2. Switch live code to new things\r\n\r\nLet's update our user-facing code to fall in line with our DB changes. Our Notes admin is now\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass NoteAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\r\n    fields = ('user', 'date', 'text')\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a real site, you'd also be updating any other views that accessed the old `date_and_text` field and switching them over to the new `date` and `text` fields.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll comment out the old `date_and_text` field in our `models.py` so Django no longer expects to see it in the database. It will hang around in the DB for a little bit longer, but from now on Django will ignore it.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Note(models.Model):\r\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User)\r\n    # date_and_text = models.TextField(blank=True)\r\n    date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\r\n    text = models.TextField(blank=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point, **nowhere** in our Python code should be referencing the old `date_and_text` field. Any webserver running the new code will be showing users the \"new\" Note fields.\r\n\r\nWe're finally ready to start updating our production server and database!\r\n\r\n1. Run `python manage.py migrate` on our production database, corresponding to the migration we made in step 1 (do NOT make or run a migration corresponding to the change we just made in `models.py`). Our live code on the webservers doesn't yet know about these new `date` and `text` fields we just added to the database, but we're safe since both are allowed to be blank/null. Django will ignore them during SELECT operations, and the database will be okay with null values during INSERT/UPDATE operations.\r\n2. Deploy the new Python code to our webservers. Assuming that we have a cluster of servers with rolling deployments, at any given time some servers may have the old code version and some servers may have the new code version. Since we've loosened any constraints on our fields, both the old and new code versions should work properly.\r\n3. Wait for all webservers to update to the new code version.\r\n\r\n### 3. Migrate data\r\n\r\nAt this stage, our site users are interacting with the new Note object. Any new notes they make are stored in the new `date` and `text` fields.\r\n\r\n**We do have a temporary inconvenience: users can't yet see existing notes.** After step 2.2 and before we perform this data migration, the text values for existing notes aren't visible on the website. The information is all there in the database, but we haven't yet transferred it to the new fields which are actually visible. Later on, I'll explain how to get around this issue if it would present a problem.\r\n\r\nLet's make a data migration to parse and copy the old notes field, as we did in the earlier section. Run `python manage.py makemigrations myapp --empty`. Update the contents like so:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\r\n\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nfrom django.db import migrations\r\n\r\n\r\ndef parse_date_and_text(date_and_text):\r\n    header, text = date_and_text.split('\\n', 1)\r\n    date = datetime.strptime(header.strip(), '%Y-%m-%d').date()\r\n    return date, text\r\n\r\n\r\ndef forwards(apps, schema_editor):\r\n    Note = apps.get_model('myapp', 'Note')\r\n    for note in Note.objects.all():\r\n        note.date, note.text = parse_date_and_text(note.date_and_text)\r\n        note.save()\r\n\r\ndef backwards(apps, schema_editor):\r\n    Note = apps.get_model('myapp', 'Note')\r\n    for note in Note.objects.all():\r\n        note.date_and_text = '{}\\n{}'.format(note.date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), note.text)\r\n        note.save()\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Migration(migrations.Migration):\r\n\r\n    dependencies = [\r\n        ('myapp', '0002_auto_20160408_1620'),\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    operations = [\r\n        migrations.RunPython(forwards, reverse_code=backwards)\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur data migration parses and copies data from the old and hidden `date_and_text` field to the new `date` and `text` fields. Remember how we waited for all our new code to deploy before performing this step? That ensured that nobody had added anything new to `date_and_text` that we could potentially overlook.\r\n\r\nI also added a reverse method `backwards()` to make this data migration reversible. If we ran into problems, this would let us safely bring our database schema back to the starting point, keeping our data intact.\r\n\r\nLet's apply this data migration right away so people can once again see their old/existing notes: run `python manage.py migrate` on the production database. Note that Django might complain about model changes not being in a migration (from when we commented out `date_and_text` in our `models.py` earlier) but that's fine for now. We'll take care of that next.\r\n\r\n### 4. Remove old things & tighten constraints\r\n\r\nWe're almost done! From a site user's point of view, everything has been fully switched to the new system. All that's left to do is remove the old model field and introduce the database constraints that we removed or left out earlier. Let's bring our `Note` model in line with what we wanted all along:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Note(models.Model):\r\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User)\r\n    date = models.DateField(auto_now=True)\r\n    text = models.TextField()\r\n\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        unique_together = (('user', 'date'),)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `python manage.py makemigrations myapp`. Django doesn't know that we previously wrote a data migration to fill in the `date` field, so we'll humor it: type \"1\", then enter `timezone.now()`.\r\n\r\nThis final migration makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Re-enabled `auto_now=True` for our `date` field (introduce feature).\r\n2. Makes the `date` field required (introduce constraint).\r\n3. Makes the `text` field required (introduce constraint).\r\n4. Removes the old `date_and_text` field for good (remove old stuff).\r\n5. Adds our unique constraint for user+date (introduce constraint).\r\n\r\nThe only change we'll make to this migration is an extra data operation to ensure our existing data obeys the new uniqueness constraint. We'll go through all notes and merge ones by the same user on the same date. Our migration file now looks like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\r\n\r\nfrom collections import defaultdict\r\nimport datetime\r\nfrom django.db import migrations, models\r\nfrom django.utils.timezone import utc\r\n\r\n\r\ndef make_unique(apps, schema_editor):\r\n    Note = apps.get_model('myapp', 'Note')\r\n    user_date_notes = defaultdict(list)\r\n    for note in Note.objects.all():\r\n        user_date_notes[(note.user, note.date)].append(note)\r\n\r\n    # Merge notes from the same user on the same date\r\n    for notes_list in user_date_notes.values():\r\n        if len(notes_list) > 1:\r\n            new_text = '\\n\\n'.join([note.text for note in notes_list])\r\n            notes_list[0].text = new_text\r\n            notes_list[0].save()\r\n            for i in range(1, len(notes_list)):\r\n                notes_list[i].delete()\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Migration(migrations.Migration):\r\n\r\n    dependencies = [\r\n        ('myapp', '0003_auto_20160408_1621'),\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    operations = [\r\n        migrations.AlterField(\r\n            model_name='note',\r\n            name='date',\r\n            field=models.DateField(auto_now=True, default=datetime.datetime(2016, 4, 8, 20, 41, 25, 872000, tzinfo=utc)),\r\n            preserve_default=False,\r\n        ),\r\n        migrations.AlterField(\r\n            model_name='note',\r\n            name='text',\r\n            field=models.TextField(),\r\n        ),\r\n        migrations.RemoveField(\r\n            model_name='note',\r\n            name='date_and_text',\r\n        ),\r\n        migrations.RunPython(make_unique, reverse_code=migrations.RunPython.noop),\r\n        migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(\r\n            name='note',\r\n            unique_together=set([('user', 'date')]),\r\n        ),\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, run this migration on the production database: `python manage.py migrate`. That's it!\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe just performed a sequence of migrations to swap our old Note model for a new one on our live production server. Even with our cluster of webservers, no user should have ever seen a server error. The only side-effect was that for a couple minutes, users weren't able to view existing notes. In a future post, I'll show how to add a few more steps to prevent even that scenario!\r\n",
